# flux
Flux is a declarative DSL engine that combines OOP and FP principles to created an abstracted "action-oriented" execution layer. It includes declarative components in its core instead of imperative control flow. These components allow for while loops that change their break conditions mid iteration, and binary switch cases that resolve recursively.
